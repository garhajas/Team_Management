# Team_Management
This program maintains information of players for a soccer team

You can perform the following actions on the program:
  Add a player, delete a player, search for palyer(s) by rating or name, and print all the palyers in your team.
  
The data in the team will be stored in memory with the use of a linked list, with list nodes representing
players. 

The challenging part of this program was to maintain the linkedlist in a special order based on the position of players. 
    
    1) Goalie
    2) Defenders
    3) Midfielders
    4) Strikers
  * If there are more than one player of the same positon, then they are kept in the order of thier insertion. 
  
 The command-line interface and the user menu will guide the user to make proper use of the program with error messages for invalid inputs.
